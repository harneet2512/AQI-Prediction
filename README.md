### Overview:

This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi, India, using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA), multiple regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). It aims to improve the accuracy of AQI prediction compared to traditional methods.

### Key Points:

Data: Historical air quality and meteorological data from Delhi, including ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.
Methodology:
PCA: Identifies the most significant factors influencing AQI and reduces data dimensionality.
Multiple Regression: Analyzes the identified factors and their impact on AQI.
ANN: Trained on the processed data to learn complex relationships between input variables and AQI.
Results:
The proposed method outperforms traditional methods in AQI prediction accuracy.
ANN shows superior performance compared to multiple regression alone.
Potential Applications:
Improved air quality forecasting in Delhi.
Planning and implementing effective air pollution control measures.
Providing real-time air quality information to the public.
Getting Started:

### Download the full paper from the provided link.
Install necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow).
Follow the steps outlined in the paper to reproduce the analysis and build your own AQI prediction model.
Further Exploration:

Investigate the influence of different ANN architectures on prediction accuracy.
Apply the model to other cities facing air quality challenges.
Integrate the model with air quality monitoring systems for real-time predictions.
